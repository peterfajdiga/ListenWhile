# ListenWhile

Listen while walking, driving, mowing...

ListenWhile is a very simple audio playback app with headphone controls for rewinding and fast-forwarding, making sure you don't miss a thing.

Use it to listen to a talk, a podcast, an audiobook, or anything else. All you need is an audio file on your phone.
